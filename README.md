Key Features
ðŸ”¹ Password Strength Analysis
The tool evaluates password security based on:
âœ” Length Check â€“ Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
âœ” Common Passwords Check â€“ Compares against a list of commonly used passwords to prevent weak selections.
âœ” Repetition Detection â€“ Detects repeated sequences of characters to prevent predictable patterns.

âœ” AES-based Encryption â€“ Uses cryptography.fernet to encrypt and decrypt passwords.
âœ” Automatic Encryption Key Handling â€“ Generates a secret key (key.key) that is used for encrypting and decrypting passwords.
âœ” Structured Storage â€“ Saves passwords in a JSON file (passwords.json), associating each password with a website.

ðŸ”¹ Easy Password Retrieval
Users can retrieve their stored passwords by providing the associated website name. The tool decrypts and displays the password securely.

âœ” Quick Lookup â€“ Retrieves passwords in seconds.
âœ” Decryption on Demand â€“ The password remains encrypted in storage and is only decrypted when accessed
